Beyond RPC is a framework combining 3D Point Cloud Adaptive Contrastive Learning with WOLFMix 

## üîç Key Contributions

- ‚úÖ **Adaptive Contrastive Learning**: Intra-modal and cross-modal contrastive losses with dynamic EWMA weighting.
- ‚úÖ **Pretraining with DGCNN**: Using RGB or grayscale renderings as the secondary modality.
- ‚úÖ **Evaluation on Corrupted Data**: Includes PointCloud-C evaluation on ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart.
